    PLACE, the Position-based Library Archive Coordinate Explorer, is a University of New Hampshire (UNH) geospatial search interface that enables easier discovery of digital collections that can be difficult to locate through standard library catalog text-based searching. Through PLACE, via a click or delineation of a search polygon on a web map, users can zoom to a region and then locate and download texts, maps, and images whose geographic extents intersect the search area. Current collections include maps, aerial photos, geologic field grip guides, and historic atlases. PLACE maintains interoperability with Open Geoportal.
