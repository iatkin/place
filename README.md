To use the PLACE project, create a new Django project and place all these files in the created directory. Replace the generated
urls.py file with the one provided and add the settings in the additional_settings.py file to the project's settings.py. The
last 3 settings in additional_settings.py are appended to the existing setting. Please note that in order for the Current
Location function to work, the website must be served over HTTPS.
